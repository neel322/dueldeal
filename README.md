#🛍️ DualDeal — Buy & Sell Marketplace Web App

DualDeal is a modern front-end marketplace web application that allows users to buy, sell, and manage products with support for both fixed price listings and auction-style items.
The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, with data persistence handled through LocalStorage (no backend required).

This project demonstrates core concepts of frontend development, UI/UX design, client-side state management, and e-commerce workflows.

#🧠 How It Works

The application uses LocalStorage as a lightweight database:

Products stored in localStorage

Cart items stored separately

Wishlist data stored per user

Orders saved after checkout

Logged-in user session stored locally

On page load, JavaScript dynamically:

Injects the global navbar

Loads product data

Updates cart counters

Displays user-specific content

The system initializes with sample products if no data exists.
